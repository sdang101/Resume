Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Checker <br>
Fall 2020 <br>
https://github.com/adamskel78/SHAX_group_project/tree/master
Created a supervised machine learning model that predicts presence of cardiovascular with 73.4% accuracy<br>
- Engineered BMI and blood pressure categorical features by developing functions that take in the height and weight features for
BMI, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure features for blood pressure categorical feature
- Used pandas to create dataframes and matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to visualized age vs. CVD, BMI vs. CVD, etc. in a bar/pie
chart
- Trained 6 supervised machine learning models with the highest training accuracy (73.6%) and testing accuracy (73.4%) yielded
from the Gradient Boosting Tree
Bike Sharing Program in Des Moines, Iowa <br>
Summer 2020<br>
https://public.tableau.com/profile/shannon.dang#!/vizhome/bike_15939944330200/DesMoinesCitiBikeProposal?publish=yes
Created a story about the potential of a bike sharing program in Des Moines by comparing it to NYC Citi Bike Sharing program data and
McDonaldʼs locations in NYC and Des Moines/
- Found that Des Moinesʼs McDonaldʼs location is more spread out and less than NYC McDonaldʼs location, thus the bike stations
in Des Moines will need to be more spread out and less than in NYC
